In efforts to control and limit the spread of COVID-19 many early detection methods are reviewed in this survey. Pneumonia has proven to be closely related to COVID-19 in how it appears on X-rays. This can affect the accuracy of diagnosis for both Pneumonia and COVID-19 when using X-ray imaging. Therefore, this survey will analyze current leading, highly accurate models for COVID-19 detection and its comparison to Pneumonia. These models adopted a variety of different approaches and performance metrics that this survey reviews. The current leading models at detecting COVID-19 are VGG-19, ResNet-50, and Histogram of Oriented Gradients in conjunction with the Support Vector Machines approach.', '']\",\n          \"['Abstract:\\\\nDue to the scarcity of labeled data, Contrastive Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) frameworks have lately shown great potential in several medical image analysis tasks. However, the existing contrastive mechanisms are sub-optimal for dense pixel-level segmentation tasks due to their inability to mine local features. To this end, we extend the concept of metric learning to the segmentation task, using a dense (dis)similarity learning for pre-training a deep encoder network, and employing a semi-supervised paradigm to fine-tune for the downstream task. Specifically, we propose a simple convolutional projection head for obtaining dense pixel-level features, and a new contrastive loss to utilize these dense projections thereby improving the local representations. A bidirectional consistency regularization mechanism involving two-stream model training is devised for the downstream task. Upon comparison, our IDEAL method outperforms the SoTA methods by fair margins on cardiac MRI segmentation. Our source codes are publicly accessible at: https://github.com/Rohit-Kundu/IDEAL-ICASSP23.', '']\",\n          \"['Abstract:\\\\nThe papers in this special section focus on skin image analysis using deep learning applications. Skin is the largest organ of the human body, and is the first area of a patient assessed by clinical staff. The skin delivers numerous insights into a patient\\u2019s underlying health: for example, pale or blue skin suggests respiratory issues, unusually yellowish skin can signal hepatic issues, or certain rashes can be indicative of autoimmune issues. Dermatological complaints are the most prevalent reason that patients seek primary care, and images of the skin are the most easily captured form of medical image in healthcare. However, certain serious skin diseases are not reliably diagnosed by primary care. Out of all medical imaging datasets, skin images are the most similar to other standard computer vision datasets. However, significant and unique challenges still exist in this domain. In addition, there are remarkable visual similarities among skin diseases, and compared to other medical imaging domains, varying genetics, disease states, imaging equipment, and imaging conditions can significantly alter the appearance of the skin, making automated analysis in this domain highly challenging.', '']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

In efforts to control and limit the spread of COVID-19 many early detection methods are reviewed in this survey. Pneumonia has proven to be closely related to COVID-19 in how it appears on X-rays. This can affect the accuracy of diagnosis for both Pneumonia and COVID-19 when using X-ray imaging. Therefore, this survey will analyze current leading, highly accurate models for COVID-19 detection and its comparison to Pneumonia. These models adopted a variety of different approaches and performance metrics that this survey reviews. The current leading models at detecting COVID-19 are VGG-19, ResNet-50, and Histogram of Oriented Gradients in conjunction with the Support Vector Machines approach.', '']\",\n          \"['Abstract:\\\\nDue to the scarcity of labeled data, Contrastive Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) frameworks have lately shown great potential in several medical image analysis tasks. However, the existing contrastive mechanisms are sub-optimal for dense pixel-level segmentation tasks due to their inability to mine local features. To this end, we extend the concept of metric learning to the segmentation task, using a dense (dis)similarity learning for pre-training a deep encoder network, and employing a semi-supervised paradigm to fine-tune for the downstream task. Specifically, we propose a simple convolutional projection head for obtaining dense pixel-level features, and a new contrastive loss to utilize these dense projections thereby improving the local representations. A bidirectional consistency regularization mechanism involving two-stream model training is devised for the downstream task. Upon comparison, our IDEAL method outperforms the SoTA methods by fair margins on cardiac MRI segmentation.

The skin delivers numerous insights into a patient\\u2019s underlying health: for example, pale or blue skin suggests respiratory issues, unusually yellowish skin can signal hepatic issues, or certain rashes can be indicative of autoimmune issues. Dermatological complaints are the most prevalent reason that patients seek primary care, and images of the skin are the most easily captured form of medical image in healthcare. However, certain serious skin diseases are not reliably diagnosed by primary care. Out of all medical imaging datasets, skin images are the most similar to other standard computer vision datasets. However, significant and unique challenges still exist in this domain. In addition, there are remarkable visual similarities among skin diseases, and compared to other medical imaging domains, varying genetics, disease states, imaging equipment, and imaging conditions can significantly alter the appearance of the skin, making automated analysis in this domain highly challenging.', '']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"title_processed\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 880,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"a medical imaging review for covid-19 detection and its comparison to pneumonia\",\n          \"ideal: improved dense local contrastive learning for semi-supervised medical image segmentation\",\n          \"guest editorial skin image analysis in the age of deep learning\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Abstracts_processed\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 880,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"covid-19 has claimed millions of lives and devastated economies worldwide in efforts to control and limit the spread of covid-19 many early detection methods are reviewed in this survey pneumonia has proven to be closely related to covid-19 in how it appears on x-rays this can affect the accuracy of diagnosis for both pneumonia and covid-19 when using x-ray imaging therefore this survey will analyze current leading highly accurate models for covid-19 detection and its comparison to pneumonia these models adopted a variety of different approaches and performance metrics that this survey reviews the current leading models at detecting covid-19 are vgg-19 resnet-50 and histogram of oriented gradients in conjunction with the support vector machines approach \",\n          \"due to the scarcity of labeled data contrastive self-supervised learning (ssl) frameworks have lately shown great potential in several medical image analysis tasks however the existing contrastive mechanisms are sub-optimal for dense pixel-level segmentation tasks due to their inability to mine local features to this end we extend the concept of metric learning to the segmentation task using a dense (dis)similarity learning for pre-training a deep encoder network and employing a semi-supervised paradigm to fine-tune for the downstream task specifically we propose a simple convolutional projection head for obtaining dense pixel-level features and a new contrastive loss to utilize these dense projections thereby improving the local representations a bidirectional consistency regularization mechanism involving two-stream model training is devised for the downstream task upon comparison our ideal method outperforms the sota methods by fair margins on cardiac mri segmentation our source codes are publicly accessible at: https://githubcom/rohit-kundu/ideal-icassp23 \",\n          \"the papers in this special section focus on skin image analysis using deep learning applications skin is the largest organ of the human body and is the first area of a patient assessed by clinical staff the skin delivers numerous insights into a patient\\u2019s underlying health: for example pale or blue skin suggests respiratory issues unusually yellowish skin can signal hepatic issues or certain rashes can be indicative of autoimmune issues dermatological complaints are the most prevalent reason that patients seek primary care and images of the skin are the most easily captured form of medical image in healthcare however certain serious skin diseases are not reliably diagnosed by primary care out of all medical imaging datasets skin images are the most similar to other standard computer vision datasets however significant and unique challenges still exist in this domain in addition there are remarkable visual similarities among skin diseases and compared to other medical imaging domains varying genetics disease states imaging equipment and imaging conditions can significantly alter the appearance of the skin making automated analysis in this domain highly challenging \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Models_Used\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 40,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"DeepLab\",\n          \"U-Net, GAN\",\n          \"DenseNet, Xception, U-Net\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
